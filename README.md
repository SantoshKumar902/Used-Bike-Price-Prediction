# Used-Bike-Price-Prediction
This project involves analyzing and predicting the resale prices of used bikes based on various features like model name, brand, engine capacity (CC), mileage, power, kilometers driven, and ownership type. The goal is to build a regression model that can help estimate a fair selling price for any used bike.
